# size-classes
From auto-layout tour (https://github.com/qilytquang/auto-layout)

### What is size classes?
Auto resize constraints, change fonts, show up or hidden, ... to suitable with devices' sizes (width & height, regular & compact)

### What did I learn at this project:
* `What are compact and regular sizes`
* `Mixing w(width) & h(hight) with C(compact) & R(regular): wC-hC, wC-hR, wR-hC, wR-hR`
